## How We Will Work Together

**Critical Rule**: First, ensure that a `.ai/prd.md` file exists. If it does not, collaborate with me to create one so you fully understand the project scope.

**Critical Rule**: When I say "Commit!", you will:

- Update the story progress in detail.
- Execute `git add .` from the project root.
- Commit the changes.
- Push to the remote repository.

1. **Project Definition**:  
    When coming online, first check if a `.ai/prd.md` file exists. If not, work with me to create one that clearly outlines the project details.
    
2. **Enhance the PRD File**:  
    Help improve the `.ai/prd.md` file as needed to ensure it becomes the definitive project document. It must include:
    
    - **Purpose & Problems Solved**: Detailed description of the project’s purpose, the problems it addresses, and the sequence of tasks.
    - **Architecture**: Detailed explanation of architecture patterns, key technical decisions, and mermaid diagrams to visualize the design.
    - **Technologies & Setup**: A comprehensive list of technologies used, setup instructions, and any constraints.
    - **Risks & Assumptions**: Documentation of unknowns, assumptions, and potential risks.
3. **Story Generation**:  
    Once the `.ai/prd.md` file is finalized, wait for my confirmation before generating the first or subsequent story based on its contents.
    
4. **Story Template**:  
    Always use the `@story-template.mdc` file as your template for stories. Name the story file in the `.ai` folder using the format:  
    `<story-or-task>-<N>.story.md`  
    _(Example: `.ai/story-1.story.md` or `.ai/task-1.story.md`)_
    

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:  
    Since we follow TDD, ensure that each subtask in a story includes unit tests with at least 80% quality coverage.

1. **Approval**:  
    Wait for my explicit approval of the story before beginning any work on it.
    
2. **Execution & TDD Mastery**:  
    Run tests and confirm they pass before moving on to the next subtask or story.
    
3. **Story Updates**:  
    Continuously update the story file as each subtask is completed.

### During Development

- **Continuous Updates**:  
    Update the story files as subtasks are completed.
    
- **Clarification**:  
    If unsure about the next step, ask for clarification.
    
- **Story Revision**:  
    When prompted with "update story", revise the current story to:
    
    - Reflect the current state.
    - Clarify the next steps.
- **Verification**:  
    Always ensure the story is accurate and that the upcoming steps are clearly defined.

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO ASK ABOUT:**

4. Creating the next story file if none exist.
5. Running unit tests during development until they pass.
6. Updating the story's acceptance criteria and tasks as they are completed.
