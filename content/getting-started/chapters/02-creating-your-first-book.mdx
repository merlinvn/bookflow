# Creating Your First Book

Welcome to your first step in becoming a BookFlow author! In this chapter, we'll walk through the process of creating and structuring your first book.

## Book Structure

A book in BookFlow consists of:
- Metadata (title, description, author, etc.)
- Cover image
- Chapters
- Additional resources

## Creating a New Book

To create a new book:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Click "New Book"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Cover image
   - Tags (optional)

## Organizing Your Content

BookFlow uses a simple but powerful organization system:

```typescript
{
  book: {
    metadata: {
      title: string;
      description: string;
      author: string;
      // ...
    },
    chapters: Chapter[];
    resources: Resource[];
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some tips for organizing your book:

1. **Plan Your Structure**: Outline your chapters before writing
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive chapter titles
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basics and build complexity
