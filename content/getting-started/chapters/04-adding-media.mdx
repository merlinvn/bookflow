# Adding Media Content

Rich media content can significantly enhance your book's educational value. Let's explore how to add various types of media to your BookFlow content.

## Images

Adding images is straightforward with our optimized Image component:

```jsx
<Image
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Descriptive text"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

Here's an example image:

<Image
  src="https://picsum.photos/800/400"
  alt="Sample landscape image"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

## Videos

Embed videos from popular platforms:

```jsx
<Video
  src="https://example.com/video.mp4"
  title="Video Title"
  poster="/thumbnail.jpg"
/>
```

## Code Demos

Interactive code demonstrations:

```jsx
<CodeDemo title="React Component Example">
  function Welcome({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
  }
</CodeDemo>
```

## Diagrams

Create diagrams using Mermaid:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> B
```

## Best Practices

1. **Optimization**: Use appropriate image sizes and formats
2. **Accessibility**: Always include alt text for images
3. **Loading**: Consider lazy loading for better performance
4. **Responsiveness**: Ensure media works on all devices
