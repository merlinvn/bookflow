# Story 2: Multiple Books & Chapter File Structure

## Story
**As an** author  
**I want** to organize my books and chapters in a clear file structure  
**so that** I can manage multiple books and their content efficiently.

## Status
In Progress

## Context
We need to establish a scalable and maintainable file structure for books and their chapters. Each book will be stored in its own directory under a `content` folder, with chapters as MDX files. We'll also implement the necessary Next.js configuration to handle dynamic routing and MDX content rendering.

## Estimation
Story Points: 0.2 (approximately 20 minutes of AI development time)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [x] Create a `content` directory with proper structure for books and chapters
2. - [x] Set up MDX configuration and dependencies
3. - [x] Implement dynamic routing for books and chapters
4. - [x] Create interfaces for book and chapter metadata
5. - [x] Add utility functions for content management
6. - [x] Implement content loading and rendering
7. - [x] Add example book with multiple chapters
8. - [x] Ensure proper TypeScript types for all components

## Subtasks
1. - [x] Set up content structure
   1. - [x] Create `content` directory
   2. - [x] Create example book directory
   3. - [x] Add sample chapters in MDX format
   4. - [x] Define metadata schema for books and chapters

2. - [x] Configure MDX support
   1. - [x] Install necessary MDX dependencies
   2. - [x] Set up MDX configuration
   3. - [x] Create MDX components
   4. - [x] Add syntax highlighting support

3. - [x] Implement content loading
   1. - [x] Create utility functions for reading content
   2. - [x] Add metadata parsing
   3. - [x] Implement content caching
   4. - [x] Add error handling

4. - [ ] Set up dynamic routing
   1. - [ ] Create book list page
   2. - [ ] Create book details page
   3. - [ ] Create chapter page
   4. - [ ] Add navigation between chapters

## Constraints
- Must use TypeScript for type safety
- Must support frontmatter in MDX files
- Must handle errors gracefully
- Must be performant with many books/chapters
- Must support proper SEO metadata

## Dev Notes
- Using `@next/mdx` for MDX support
- Implementing proper caching for better performance
- Adding TypeScript types for all content structures
- Following Next.js 14+ best practices

## Progress Notes As Needed
- Created content directory structure ✓
- Set up MDX with necessary plugins ✓
- Created TypeScript interfaces for content types ✓
- Implemented content management utilities ✓
- Added custom MDX components with styling ✓
- Next: Implement dynamic routing for books and chapters
