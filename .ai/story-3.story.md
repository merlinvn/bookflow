# Story 3: Enhanced Reading Experience & Interactive Features

## Story
**As a** reader  
**I want** an immersive and interactive reading experience  
**so that** I can better engage with and learn from the content.

## Constraints
- Must maintain fast page load times
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1)
- Must be mobile-responsive
- Must follow React best practices

## Dev Notes
- Using `react-intersection-observer` for scroll tracking ✓
- Implementing `prism-react-renderer` for code blocks ✓
- Using `lucide-react` for consistent iconography ✓
- Implementing click-outside behavior with `useRef` and `useEffect` ✓

## Progress Notes
- Added TableOfContents component with smooth scrolling and active section highlighting ✓
- Implemented ReadingProgress component with progress persistence ✓
- Created unified ReadingTools component with improved UX:
  - Navigation menu with book and chapter links ✓
  - Theme toggle with proper positioning ✓
  - Click-outside behavior for better interaction ✓
- Updated MDX components with proper heading IDs ✓
- Added CodeBlock component with syntax highlighting and copy functionality ✓
- All MVP features completed with enhanced user experience ✓

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to next story. Deferred features can be implemented in future iterations based on user feedback and product priorities.
