# Story 1: Next.js and TailwindCSS Setup

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up a Next.js project with TailwindCSS  
**so that** we have a solid foundation for building our book publishing platform.

## Status
In Progress

## Context
This is the initial setup story that will establish our development environment. We need a modern, performant framework (Next.js) combined with a utility-first CSS framework (TailwindCSS) to build a responsive and themeable book publishing platform. This setup will include dark/light mode support and ensure we have a proper development environment.
